# What is this?

Example for creating an SVG in Affinity Designer and then exporting as an SVG and animating using CSS.

I wanted to see how I could animate some of the SVGs I had been drawing using Affinity Designer.

To animate I am using CSS only.

# How?

You can name a group or single layer in AD (Affinity Designer). This will set the ID for the group or path to the name you set in AD.

You can then use CSS to transform or animate in other ways these IDs.

In shark.html you can see how I animate using CSS.

If you open up the AD file here you can see I took my shark I had drawn as a solid object and broke up the path around the mouth. Then named everything I needed to move with a name ending in Head.

Then I copied over the SVG into my html and was able to use the css IDs to animate.
